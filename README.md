# About
This is the Tohono O'odham Helper. Tohono O'odham is a Native American language spoken in the southwestern United States and Mexico. One of the features of this language is that there are two official writing systems that are commonly used to represent it.

The purpose of this simple program is to automatically transliterate a text written in one of the official systems to the other. It optionally embeds its output into a LaTeX template at the user's request. This is a CLI (Command Line Interface) application written in the Haskell programming language.
